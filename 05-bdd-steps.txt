# BDD steps

It is time for developing the gherkin steps.
We will build two kinds of steps: 
- Simple
- Complex
Complex steps are just a bunch of simple steps that are merged into only one.
This principle will allow great reusability coverage if performed right.
How to differenciate them? By using a Domain Specific Language agreement: the step definition will include words combination that will made it clear.

The framework, i.e. the steps library, will be built upon that foundation, embracing new feature areas by developing simple and complex steps accordingly
Another requirement for step reusability is that each step must not infere any information from previous steps, it must be auto-defined, for example, the page where the action is performed

LOGIN

Feature: Dummmy Feature

Scenario: Successful Login when using valid user and valid password
    Given I am "standard_user" user  --> Simple Step
    When I login with user "valid" password  --> Simple Step
    Then I see "Products" page  --> Simple Step
        - L3. CP1: page title
Scenario Outline: Invalid Login when using valid user and locked user and invalid password
    Given I am "<user>" user  --> Simple Step
    When I login with user "invalid" password  --> Simple Step
    Then I see "Login" error at Login page  --> Simple Step
        - L1. CP1: error element + configured text

Examples:
    | user |
    | standard_user |
    | locked_out_user |

Scenario: Locked Out login when using locked out user and valid password
    Given I am "locked_out_user" user  --> Simple Step
    When I login with user "valid" password  --> Simple Step
    Then I see "Locked_Out" error at Login page  --> Simple Step
        - L1. CP1: error element + configured text 
    
 With just 4 parametrised steps we have covered the LOGIN features area
- I am "(standard_user|locked_out_user)" user
- I login with user "(valid|invalid)" password
- I see "(Products)" page
- I see "(Login|Locked_Out)" error at Login page

Next step is to build the BDD steps, by selecting the appropiate key words, that efficiently cover the user navigation actions

[PAGE] PRODUCTS

The tests we already have are only mention the conditions and the checkpoints, we need to build the navigation steps, including the login
Since the less steps the better, we should integrate the login action into just one step 

 - Product Detail access. Name
        - L3. CP1: page title
Given I am logged into Products page with "standard_user" user --> Complex step
When I select "unselected" "random" product "name" --> Simple step. No page reference since it is the only page where you can see more than one product 
Then I see Detail page for "selected" product --> Simple step with product reference

 - Product Detail access. Image
Given I am logged into Products page with "standard_user" user--> Complex step
When I select "unselected" "random" product "image" --> Simple step. No page reference since it is the only page where you can see more than one product

When I select "All Items" option at left menu
Then I see "Products" page  --> Simple Step
And I see the "Menu option" at "Products" page
And I see the "products grid" at "Products" page

 - About SauceLabs
        - L3. CP1: Saucelabs page title

Then I see no badge in shopping cart at "Products" page --> Simple step with page reference
And I see product option is "Add To Cart" for "all" products
   

Wrapping up the new steps:

Usually the steps are splitted into several files, the most common criteria is to group them by page.
So previous login steps will be at the login page steps file (except I see "Products" page) and these products page steps wiil be at the products page steps file.
More on this ... Cucumber framework allows to repeat the same parametrised step in several files, as long as their parameter's value is different.
In any case, this technique only applies for Cucumber files, take into account that steps library in the test management tool (Xray) can see the steps library as a whole

So, for products page (plus the previous I see "Products" page step) we've got these steps:
- I am logged into Products page with "standard_user" user --> Complex step
- I select "(random|<any product name>)" product "(name|image)" --> Simple step (no need for page reference since Products page is the only page where you can select random productS)
-- New version: I select "(selected|unselected)" "(random|<any product name>)" product "(name|image)" -->  Detail tests uncovered a new need in this step. so this new version is needed.
- I select "(Add To Cart|Remove)" option for "(1|2)" "(selected|unselected)" random products -->  --> Simple step (no need for page reference since Products page is the only page where you can select random productS)
- I select "(Shopping Cart|Menu)" option at "Products" page --> Simple step with page reference
- I see product option is "(Add To Cart|Remove)" for "(selected|all)" products --> Simple step (no need for page reference since Products page is the only page where you can select random productS)
- I see product option is "(Add To Cart|Remove)" for "last" "selected" product
- I see "(1|2)" badge in shopping cart at "Products" page --> Simple step with page reference
- I see no badge in shopping cart at "Products" page --> Simple step with page reference
- I see the "(Menu option|product grid)" at "Products" page
Plus we add a value to the parametrised step. This time is for convenience, since Saucelabs page is not going to be tested
- I see "(Products|Saucelabs)" page

New steps for login page
- I see "Login" option at "Login" page  --> Simple Step

Also a new file for Detail page steps
- I see Detail page for "(selected|<any product name>)" product --> Simple step with product reference

And another one for Your Cart page. Be aware of the parametrised step is the same as I see "Products" page, but with different value
- I see "Your Cart" page

For this project We have chosen to create a dedicated file also for left menu steps:
- I see the left menu
- I select "(All Items|Logout|About|Reset App State|Close)" option at left menu



 [PAGE]  DETAIL

Wrapping up new steps. 
Notice the first one in Products page steps and first one in Detail page steps: Bold examples of complex steps: login + navigation in a single step.

Products page steps
- I select "Add To Cart" option for "(1|2)" "(selected|unselected)" random products when logged as "standard_user" user --> Complex step
- New version: I select "(selected|unselected)" "random" product "(image|name)" --> This new step version is needed here for ensuring the Detail's product is not in the cart.

Detail page steps
- I select "(selected|unselected)" random product "(name|image)" when logged as "standard_user" user --> Complex step
- I select "(Add To Cart|Remove|Back To Products|Shopping Cart|Menu)" option at "Detail" page --> Simple step with page reference
- I see product option is "(Add To Cart|Remove)" for the Detail's product --> Simple step with page reference for unambiguity
- I see "(1|2)" badge in shopping cart at "Details" page --> Simple step with page reference. Repeating parametrised step with new values
- I see no badge in shopping cart at "Details" page --> Simple step with page reference


So, as we are diving into the third page, just recall the building strategy: simple steps for the current stage (page) for detailed testing, next stage will merge simple steps from previous stages into a single one.
The trick here is that you usually don't need all the simple steps parameters values combination, usually you just need to follow the happy path or the values for the parameters that will reach the needed stage (page).
